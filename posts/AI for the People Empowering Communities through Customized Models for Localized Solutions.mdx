##  Customized Solutions for Backroom Management

One notable example of AI empowering people is in the domain of inventory management. Walmart Global Tech, in  an article titled "Technology Powered for a People-Led Future" discusses  how customized AI solutions are used  to track and manage  inventory in the backroom. By leveraging AI algorithms, Walmart is able to optimize inventory levels, reduce waste, and improve operational efficiency. This localized AI model not only  empowers workers but also enhances the overall shopping experience for customers. [^1^]

## Industry-Specific AI Models

In finance,  Bloomberg has developed BloombergGPT, a 50-billion  parameter large language model customized specifically  for the  finance industry. This AI breakthrough, highlighted in their  research paper, demonstrates the potential of industry-specific AI models. By training the model on a vast corpus of financial data Bloomberg has created an AI tool that can generate intelligent insights and aid decision-making in the finance  sector. This demonstrates the power of customized AI models in providing tailored solutions  for specific industries. [^2^]

## Co-designing AI with Local  Communities

Another aspect of AI for the  People involves co-designing  AI systems  with local communities.  A research paper titled "Empowering Local Communities Using Artificial Intelligence" explores  the challenges and opportunities in designing AI systems that collect and explain community  data. The  paper emphasizes the  importance of localized solutions and the need to involve  local communities in the design process. By  taking into account the unique needs and values of  different communities AI models  can better  address their specific challenges and empower  them to find innovative solutions.  [^3^]
